🚀 Assignment: Careers Page Builder
A. The Assignment 🧠
Companies using our ATS want their Careers page to match their brand, tell their story, and make it effortless for candidates to discover and apply to open roles — especially on mobile.
You’ll build a small product that helps Recruiters create branded Careers pages for their company — and lets Candidates browse open roles from those pages.
⏰Timeline
You can finish this in ~6–8 focused hours. The 7-day window is flexible to let you work at your own pace.
💡Inspiration
Before you start, explore how some companies tell their story:
1. https://apply.workable.com/careers/#jobs
2. https://apply.workable.com/gbg
3. https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/adtucon
Notice how each page feels on-brand, simple, and easy to browse — that’s the kind of experience your product should help Recruiters build for their companies.
👥Who Uses It
User
	What they do
	Page URLs
	Recruiter
	Logs in, customizes their company’s Careers page, and shares it publicly
	/login, /company-slug/edit, /company-slug/preview
	Candidate
	Reads about the company and explores open jobs
	/<company-slug>/careers
	You (ATS Platform)
	Build the system that allows many companies to manage their own Careers pages
	—
	🧩 What You’ll Build
Recruiters should be able to:
* Set brand theme (colors, banner, logo, culture video).
* Add, remove, or reorder content sections like About Us, Life at Company, etc.
* Preview how the page will look before publishing.
* Save settings — each company’s data stored separately.
* Share their company’s public Careers link.
👉 Focus on helping recruiters easily build and customize their company Careers page — with clear, usable controls.
Candidates can:
* Learn about the company through the Careers page.
* Browse open jobs with filters (Location, Job Type) and search by Job Title.
* Experience a clean, mobile-friendly, and accessible UI (labels, contrast, keyboard focus).
* See an SEO-ready page (crawlable HTML, meta tags, structured data).
👉 You don’t need to build the job application flow — just the browsing experience.

B. What is expected from you? 🤔
✅ Submission Checklist
Keep everything clear, concise, and easy to follow.
* GitHub repo with working code and sample data
   * Production live link (Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc.)
   * Tech Spec.md — assumptions, architecture, schema, and test plan. DON’T Write this with AI.
   * README.md — how to run, what you built, improvement plan, and step-by-step user guide DON’T Write this with AI.
   * AGENT_LOG.md — Short notes on how you used AI tools, e.g., prompts, refinements, and learnings. (DON’T Write this with AI.
   * Demo video (≤5 min) — short walkthrough of your app
📤 How to Submit
Once your assignment is complete, please submit your links through the official Whitecarrot submission portal:
👉 Open Submission Portal
Enter your email address, then fill in the following details:
* Google Drive Link – upload a ZIP file of your repository (including working code, sample data, and a clear README with setup steps)

* Demo Video Link – a short walkthrough (≤ 5 minutes)
Double-check that all your links are publicly accessible before submitting.
C. Bonus Guidelines 💰
💡 Use your imagination — there’s no single “right” answer here. You’re free to approach the problem your own way, make assumptions, and design a solution that feels practical, scalable, and delightful to use.
Use AI tools at every phase — for brainstorming, UI design, and coding.
Show us how you worked with AI, where it helped, and how you improved its output.
Write clean, maintainable code following best practices — your next interview will include a short live deep-dive into your code, where you may fix or enhance something.
Focus on delivering a working, usable prototype that feels cohesive and complete — something you’d confidently demo to a real customer.
💭 Key Design Questions
* How will you store data for each company separately?
* How can recruiters easily build and customize their page?
* How will edits safely update the page?
* How can candidates browse jobs smoothly?
* How does your design adapt across devices?
* How would you scale if hundreds of companies used it?
Use any stack you prefer. Leverage design, prototyping, and AI-powered dev tools to move faster.  You can use free-tier platforms like Supabase or Neon.tech for your database.
🚀 Final Note
We care more about how you think than how perfect your code is — so take creative risks, experiment, and show us how you’d build in the real world.
 Build something you’d proudly demo. Good luck! 🚀
